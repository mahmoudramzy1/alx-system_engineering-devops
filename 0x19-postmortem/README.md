Postmortem Report: Database Server Outage on 2024-06-20
Issue Summary
Duration: 2024-06-20 14:00 UTC to 2024-06-20 16:30 UTC
Impact:
The primary database server was down, causing the main application to become inaccessible.
Users were unable to log in or retrieve data, affecting approximately 75% of active users.
Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the database serverâ€™s network settings during a routine update caused the server to become unreachable.

Timeline
14:00: Database server became unreachable, causing application failures.
14:00: Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating database connection failures.
14:05: Initial investigation by on-call engineer, confirming the database server is down.
14:10: Assumption that the issue might be due to a recent software update.
14:20: Restarted the database service, but the issue persisted.
14:30: Misleading path: checked application server logs for possible issues, found none.
14:45: Escalated to the database administration team.
15:00: Database team identified network misconfiguration as the potential cause.
15:15: Rolled back the recent network configuration changes.
15:30: Database server became accessible again.
16:00: Verified full functionality and monitored the system.
16:30: Confirmed resolution and closed the incident.
Note: At 15:00, we found that the network misconfiguration was our "needle in a haystack" moment.





Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The issue was caused by an incorrect network configuration change applied during a routine update. The change included a typo in the IP address, causing the database server to become isolated from the network.

Resolution:
The misconfiguration was identified by the database administration team after a thorough review of the recent changes.
The team rolled back the erroneous network configuration to the last known good configuration. This restored connectivity to the database server.
Post-rollback, the database server was restarted, and functionality was restored.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Enhance the configuration change review process to include peer reviews before applying changes.
Implement automated testing for network configuration changes to catch errors before deployment.
Increase the monitoring of database connectivity with more granular alerts.

Tasks:
Patch database server to include the latest security updates without causing network issues.
Add automated configuration validation scripts to the deployment pipeline.
Set up detailed monitoring for network changes, including real-time alerts on configuration discrepancies.
Conduct a training session for the team on best practices for configuration management and change control.
Review and update the incident response plan to improve the speed and efficiency of future incident resolutions.
